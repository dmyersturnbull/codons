abstract = {Codon-usage bias has been observed in almost all genomes and is thought to result from selection for efficient and accurate translation of highly expressed genes. Codon usage is also implicated in the control of transcription, splicing and RNA structure. Many genes exhibit little codon-usage bias, which is thought to reflect a lack of selection for messenger RNA translation. Alternatively, however, non-optimal codon usage may be of biological importance. The rhythmic expression and the proper function of the Neurospora FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein are essential for circadian clock function. Here we show that, unlike most genes in Neurospora, frq exhibits non-optimal codon usage across its entire open reading frame. Optimization of frq codon usage abolishes both overt and molecular circadian rhythms. Codon optimization not only increases FRQ levels but, unexpectedly, also results in conformational changes in FRQ protein, altered FRQ phosphorylation profile and stability, and impaired functions in the circadian feedback loops. These results indicate that non-optimal codon usage of frq is essential for its circadian clock function. Our study provides an example of how non-optimal codon usage functions to regulate protein expression and to achieve optimal protein structure and function.},

abstract = {Protein folding should be complex. Proteins organize themselves into specific three-dimensional structures, through a myriad of conformational changes. The classical view of protein folding describes this process as a nearly sequential series of discrete intermediates. In contrast, the energy landscape theory of folding considers folding as the progressive organization of an ensemble of partially folded structures through which the protein passes on its way to the natively folded structure. As a result of evolution, proteins have a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. Connecting theory and simulations of minimalist models with experiments has completely revolutionized our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control protein folding.},

However, there lacks a convenient platform performing similar tasks directly from 'protein sequences'. In the current version of the web server, referred to as pKNOT v.2, we implement a homology modeling tool such that the server can now accept protein sequences in addition to 3D structures or Protein Data Bank (PDB) IDs and return knot analysis. In addition, we have updated the database of knotted proteins from the current PDB with a combination of automatic and manual procedure. We believe that the updated pKNOT server with its extended functionalities will provide better service to biologists interested in the research of knotted proteins.

This database provides a jumping-off point to many other resources through the links it provides. Among others, these include other primary databases, secondary databases, the Gene Ontology and OMIM. While a large number of links are provided to Protein Data Bank (PDB) files, obtaining a regularly updated mapping between UniProtKB entries and PDB entries at the chain or residue level is not straightforward. In particular, there is no regularly updated resource which allows a UniProtKB/SwissProt entry to be identified for a given residue of a PDB file.

RESULTS: We have created a completely automatically maintained database which maps PDB residues to residues in UniProtKB/SwissProt and UniProtKB/trEMBL entries. The protocol uses links from PDB to UniProtKB, from UniProtKB to PDB and a brute-force sequence scan to resolve PDB chains for which no annotated link is available. Finally the sequences from PDB and UniProtKB are aligned to obtain a residue-level mapping.

abstract = {The persistent difficulties in the production of protein at high levels in heterologous systems, as well as the inability to understand pathologies associated with protein aggregation, highlight our limited knowledge on the mechanisms of protein folding in vivo. Attempts to improve yield and quality of recombinant proteins are diverse, frequently involving optimization of the cell growth temperature, the use of synonymous codons and/or the co-expression of tRNAs, chaperones and folding catalysts among others. Although protein secondary structure can be determined largely by the amino acid sequence, protein folding within the cell is affected by a range of factors beyond amino acid sequence. The folding pathway of a nascent polypeptide can be affected by transient interactions with other proteins and ligands, the ribosome, translocation through a pore membrane, redox conditions, among others. The translation rate as well as the translation machinery itself can dramatically affect protein folding, and thus the structure and function of the protein product. This review addresses current efforts to better understand how the use of synonymous codons in the mRNA and the availability of tRNAs can modulate translation kinetics, affecting the folding, the structure and the biological activity of proteins.},

abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that the thermodynamic stability of mRNA secondary structure near the start codon can regulate translation efficiency in Escherichia coli, and that translation is more efficient the less stable the secondary structure. We survey the complete genomes of 340 species for signals of reduced mRNA secondary structure near the start codon. Our analysis includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, insects, fishes, birds, and mammals. We find that nearly all species show evidence for reduced mRNA stability near the start codon. The reduction in stability generally increases with increasing genomic GC content. In prokaryotes, the reduction also increases with decreasing optimal growth temperature. Within genomes, there is variation in the stability among genes, and this variation correlates with gene GC content, codon bias, and gene expression level. For birds and mammals, however, we do not find a genome-wide trend of reduced mRNA stability near the start codon. Yet the most GC rich genes in these organisms do show such a signal. We conclude that reduced stability of the mRNA secondary structure near the start codon is a universal feature of all cellular life. We suggest that the origin of this reduction is selection for efficient recognition of the start codon by initiator-tRNA.},

@article{Biro2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: All the information necessary for protein folding is supposed to be present in the amino acid sequence. It is still not possible to provide specific ab initio structure predictions by bioinformatical methods. It is suspected that additional folding information is present in protein coding nucleic acid sequences, but this is not represented by the known genetic code.

RESULTS: Nucleic acid subsequences comprising the 1st and/or 3rd codon residues in mRNAs express significantly higher free folding energy (FFE) than the subsequence containing only the 2nd residues (p < 0.0001, n = 81). This periodic FFE difference is not present in introns. It is therefore a specific physico-chemical characteristic of coding sequences and might contribute to unambiguous definition of codon boundaries during translation. The FFEs of the 1st and 3rd residues are additive, which suggests that these residues contain a significant number of complementary bases and that may contribute to selection for local RNA secondary structures in coding regions. This periodic, codon-related structure-formation of mRNAs indicates a connection between the structures of exons and the corresponding (translated) proteins. The folding energy dot plots of RNAs and the residue contact maps of the coded proteins are indeed similar. Residue contact statistics using 81 different protein structures confirmed that amino acids that are coded by partially reverse and complementary codons (Watson-Crick (WC) base pairs at the 1st and 3rd codon positions and translated in reverse orientation) are preferentially co-located in protein structures.

CONCLUSION: Exons are distinguished from introns, and codon boundaries are physico-chemically defined, by periodically distributed FFE differences between codon positions. There is a selection for local RNA secondary structures in coding regions and this nucleic acid structure resembles the folding profiles of the coded proteins. The preferentially (specifically) interacting amino acids are coded by partially complementary codons, which strongly supports the connection between mRNA and the corresponding protein structures and indicates that there is protein folding information in nucleic acids that is not present in the genetic code. This might suggest an additional explanation of codon redundancy.},

We report that folding efficiency of the Escherichia coli multidomain protein SufI can be severely perturbed by alterations in ribosome-mediated translational attenuation. Such alterations were achieved by global acceleration of the translation rate with tRNA excess in vitro or by synonymous substitutions to codons with highly abundant tRNAs both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, the global slow-down of the translation rate modulated by low temperature suppresses the deleterious effect of the altered translational attenuation pattern. We propose that local discontinuous translation temporally separates the translation of segments of the peptide chain and actively coordinates their co-translational folding.},

abstract = {We previously showed that GAU codons are preferred (relative to synonymous GAC codons) for encoding aspartates specifically at the N-termini of alpha-helices in human, but not in E. coli, proteins. To test if this difference reflected a general difference between eucaryotes and procaryotes, we now extended the analysis to include the proteins and coding sequences of mammals, vertebrates, S. cerevisiae, and plants. We found that the GAU-alpha-helix correlation is also strong in non-human mammalian and vertebrate proteins but is much weaker or insignificant in S. cerevisiae and plants. The vertebrate correlations are of sufficient strength to enhance alpha-helix N-terminus prediction. Additional results, including the observation that the correlation is significantly enhanced when proteins that are known to be correctly expressed in recombinant procaryotic systems are excluded, suggest that the correlation is induced at the level of protein translation and folding and not at the nucleic acid level. To the best of our knowledge, it is not explicable by the canonical picture of protein expression and folding, suggesting the existence of a novel evolutionary selection mechanism. One possible explanation is that some alpha-helix N-terminal GAU codons may facilitate correct co-translational folding in vertebrates.},

abstract = {Because regions on the messenger ribonucleic acid differ in the rate at which they are translated by the ribosome and because proteins can fold cotranslationally on the ribosome, a question arises as to whether the kinetics of translation influence the folding events in the growing nascent polypeptide chain. Translationally slow regions were identified on mRNAs for a set of 37 multidomain proteins from Escherichia coli with known three-dimensional structures. The frequencies of individual codons in mRNAs of highly expressed genes from E. coli were taken as a measure of codon translation speed. Analysis of codon usage in slow regions showed a consistency with the experimentally determined translation rates of codons; abundant codons that are translated with faster speeds compared with their synonymous codons were found to be avoided; rare codons that are translated at an unexpectedly higher rate were also found to be avoided in slow regions. The statistical significance of the occurrence of such slow regions on mRNA spans corresponding to the oligopeptide domain termini and linking regions on the encoded proteins was assessed. The amino acid type and the solvent accessibility of the residues coded by such slow regions were also examined. The results indicated that protein domain boundaries that mark higher-order structural organization are largely coded by translationally slow regions on the RNA and are composed of such amino acids that are stickier to the ribosome channel through which the synthesized polypeptide chain emerges into the cytoplasm. The translationally slow nucleotide regions on mRNA possess the potential to form hairpin secondary structures and such structures could further slow the movement of ribosome. The results point to an intriguing correlation between protein synthesis machinery and in vivo protein folding. Examination of available mutagenic data indicated that the effects of some of the reported mutations were consistent with our hypothesis.},

abstract = {A unifying concept that combines the basic features governing self-organization of proteins into complex three-dimensional structures in vitro and in vivo is still lacking. Recent experimental results and theoretical in silico modeling studies provide evidence showing that mRNA might contain an additional layer of information, beyond the amino acid sequence, that fine-tunes in vivo protein folding, which is largely believed to start as a co-translational process. These findings indicate that translation kinetics might direct the co-translational folding pathway and that translational pausing at rare codons might provide a time delay to enable independent and sequential folding of the defined portions of the nascent polypeptide emerging from the ribosome.},

abstract = {Synonymous codon usage and variations in the level of isoaccepting tRNAs exert a powerful selective force on translation fidelity. We have developed an algorithm to evaluate the relative rate of translation which allows large-scale comparisons of the non-uniform translation rate on the protein biogenesis. Using the complete genomes of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis we show that stretches of codons pairing to minor tRNAs form putative sites to locally attenuate translation; thereby the tendency is to cluster in near proximity whereas long contiguous stretches of slow-translating triplets are avoided. The presence of slow-translating segments positively correlates with the protein length irrespective of the protein abundance. The slow-translating clusters are predominantly located down-stream of the domain boundaries presumably to fine-tune translational accuracy with the folding fidelity of multidomain proteins. Translation attenuation patterns at highly structurally and functionally conserved domains are preserved across the species suggesting a concerted selective pressure on the codon selection and species-specific tRNA abundance in these regions.},

abstract = {Translation of mRNA into protein is a unidirectional information flow process. Analysing the input (mRNA) and output (protein) of translation, we find that local protein structure information is encoded in the mRNA nucleotide sequence. The Coding Sequence and Structure (CSandS) database developed in this work provides a detailed mapping between over 4000 solved protein structures and their mRNA. CSandS facilitates a comprehensive analysis of codon usage over many organisms. In assigning translation speed, we find that relative codon usage is less informative than tRNA concentration. For all speed measures, no evidence was found that domain boundaries are enriched with slow codons. In fact, genes seemingly avoid slow codons around structurally defined domain boundaries. Translation speed, however, does decrease at the transition into secondary structure. Codons are identified that have structural preferences significantly different from the amino acid they encode. However, each organism has its own set of 'significant codons'. Our results support the premise that codons encode more information than merely amino acids and give insight into the role of translation in protein folding.},

abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) encodes a sequence of amino acids by using codons. For most amino acids, there are multiple synonymous codons that can encode the amino acid. The translation speed can vary from one codon to another, thus there is room for changing the ribosome speed while keeping the amino acid sequence and hence the resulting protein. Recently, it has been noticed that the choice of the synonymous codon, via the resulting distribution of slow- and fast-translated codons, affects not only on the average speed of one ribosome translating the mRNA but also might have an effect on nearby ribosomes by affecting the appearance of 'traffic jams' where multiple ribosomes collide and form queues. To test this 'context effect' further, we here investigate the effect of the sequence of synonymous codons on the ribosome traffic by using a ribosome traffic model with codon-dependent rates, estimated from experiments. We compare the ribosome traffic on wild-type (WT) sequences and sequences where the synonymous codons were swapped randomly. By simulating translation of 87 genes, we demonstrate that the WT sequences, especially those with a high bias in codon usage, tend to have the ability to reduce ribosome collisions, hence optimizing the cellular investment in the translation apparatus. The magnitude of such reduction of the translation time might have a significant impact on the cellular growth rate and thereby have importance for the survival of the species.},

How good any of these measures is for correlating codon usage with gene and protein expression has yet to be investigated. In this study, we correlated gene transcript levels in Escherichia coli with codon usage, using a number of different codon bias measures. We found that there is a significant correlation between transcript levels and codon bias measures, suggesting that these measures can be used to assess or predict gene expression. The codon bias measure performing best in this context was the codon adaptation index.},

This bias is most pronounced in highly expressed proteins, but a recent study of synthetic GFP-coding sequences did not find a correlation between codon usage and GFP expression, suggesting that such correlation in natural sequences is not a simple property of translational mechanisms. Here, we investigate the effect of evolutionary forces on codon usage. The relation between codon bias and protein abundance is quantitatively analyzed based on the hypothesis that codon bias evolved to ensure the efficient usage of ribosomes, a precious commodity for fast growing cells. An explicit fitness landscape is formulated based on bacterial growth laws to relate protein abundance and ribosomal load. The model leads to a quantitative relation between codon bias and protein abundance, which accounts for a substantial part of the observed bias for E. coli. Moreover, by providing an evolutionary link, the ribosome load model resolves the apparent conflict between the observed relation of protein abundance and codon bias in natural sequences and the lack of such dependence in a synthetic gfp library. Finally, we show that the relation between codon usage and protein abundance can be used to predict protein abundance from genomic sequence data alone without adjustable parameters.},

The effect is pronounced in rapidly induced genes, involves both frequent and rare codons and diminishes only slowly as a function of the distance between subsequent synonymous codons. Furthermore, we found that in S. cerevisiae codon correlation accelerates translation relative to the translation of synonymous yet anticorrelated sequences. The data suggest that tRNA diffusion away from the ribosome is slower than translation, and that some tRNA channeling takes place at the ribosome. They also establish that the dynamics of translation leave a significant signature at the level of the genome.},

One of the puzzles in evolutionary genetics is therefore to uncover evolutionary driving forces that result in specific codon choice. In many bacteria, the first 5-10 codons of protein-coding genes are often codons that are less frequently used in the rest of the genome, an effect that has been argued to arise from selection for slowed early elongation to reduce ribosome traffic jams. However, genome analysis across many species has demonstrated that the region shows reduced mRNA folding consistent with pressure for efficient translation initiation. This raises the possibility that unusual codon usage is a side effect of selection for reduced mRNA structure. Here we discriminate between these two competing hypotheses, and show that in bacteria selection favours codons that reduce mRNA folding around the translation start, regardless of whether these codons are frequent or rare. Experiments confirm that primarily mRNA structure, and not codon usage, at the beginning of genes determines the translation rate.},

abstract = {Cellular protein synthesis is a complex polymerization process carried out by multiple ribosomes translating individual mRNAs. The process must be responsive to rapidly changing conditions in the cell that could cause ribosomal pausing and queuing. In some circumstances, pausing of a bacterial ribosome can trigger translational abandonment via the process of trans-translation, mediated by tmRNA (transfer-messenger RNA) and endonucleases. Together, these factors release the ribosome from the mRNA and target the incomplete polypeptide for destruction. In eukaryotes, ribosomal pausing can initiate an analogous process carried out by the Dom34p and Hbs1p proteins, which trigger endonucleolytic attack of the mRNA, a process termed mRNA no-go decay. However, ribosomal pausing can also be employed for regulatory purposes, and controlled translational delays are used to help co-translational folding of the nascent polypeptide on the ribosome, as well as a tactic to delay translation of a protein while its encoding mRNA is being localized within the cell. However, other responses to pausing trigger ribosomal frameshift events. Recent discoveries are thus revealing a wide variety of mechanisms used to respond to translational pausing and thus regulate the flow of ribosomal traffic on the mRNA population.},
